## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript


### What I learned

- JavaScript Syntax
- The Document Object Model (DOM) 
- The window object setInterval() method for executing a timer



### Continued development

- I plan to implement JavaScript modules in my future projects.

- I hope to utilize jquery in my next work to attain a more concise code.


### Useful resources

- [Comprehensive JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com) - This course on Codecademy helped me understand JavaScript, especially the Document Object Model, which is vital for this project.
